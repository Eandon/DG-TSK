# DD-TSK model

This code is an Python implementation of the paper "Double Groups of Gates based 
Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (DG-TSK) Fuzzy System for Simultaneous Feature Selection and Rule Extraction"

The paper proposes a fuzzy model called DG-TSK in which double groups of gate
functions are embedded into the TSK fuzzy system for feature selection and rule extraction.
